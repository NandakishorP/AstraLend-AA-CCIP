#borrow function
```
ininatally in the borrow function it don't allow a single user to take multiple loans using a single asset class, a user can take
more than one loan from the protocol using multiple tokens but not using the same tokens, it will be considered and changed when the 
protocols introduces cross chain communication


also the ltv is set to 75%, later we use variable ltv, like 75% for the blue chip coins and 50% for the altcoins and 95% for the stable coins and it will be take into consideration when we introduce the flash loans and the altcoins into the protocol and make it more modular, and for now the protocol is sticked to the blue chip coins
